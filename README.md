## 🧠 How It Works

The session lines act as psychological support and resistance zones, derived from key market hours.

📌 **When the price touches these lines, there's a high probability of trend reversal or temporary pullback.** These levels are based on historical session behaviors, offering high-probability trade setups for scalpers and swing traders alike.

🚨 **The integrated alert feature ensures you are notified instantly**, so you never miss a potential setup — even when you're away from the screen.

📊 In many cases, when price reaches one of these session zones, you’ll observe a **clear behavioral shift** in the market — such as:
- A reversal in trend direction
- A turning point in market cycles
- The beginning of a breakout move

These moments can provide early entry or exit signals for high-probability trades.
